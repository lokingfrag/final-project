The popularity of the image led CNN to describe Sammy Griner, the boy depicted in the photo, as likely the Internet's most famous baby. In addition to popular use on social media, the image has been licensed for commercial use, and was used by the White House to promote immigration reform. In mid 2015, the Griner family used it to promote a GoFundMe campaign for money to pay for the father’s kidney transplant."
